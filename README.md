This project shows the basics of web deployment by editing a small web project and deploying it to Glitch. It allowed me to refresh my knowledge of working with HTML, CSS, Git and basic Node.js.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, h1, h2, ul, img, and a selectors, as well as the intro, content, text, links, and topDiv classes. 
- **Experimented with other HTML tags**: Added link, div, br, img, and a tags.  
- **Experimented with Node.js server**: Added capability to serve external css stylesheets as well as images. 

### Design Achievements
- **Create a color palette**: I created a color palette (located in assets) and used all the colors in the implementation of my website, primarily in the border gradient at the top of the page.
- **Used the Work Sans from Google Fonts**: I used Work Sans as the font in my site.
